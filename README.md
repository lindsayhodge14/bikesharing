# bikesharing

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. To solidify the proposal, one of the key stakeholders would like to see a bike trip analysis. Pandas has been used to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype so that this information may be easily displayed for him. Using the converted data, the following visualizations were created:

* Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
* Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
* Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

## Summary
Based on the results from the analysis it is important for Des Moines to consider how easily they will be able to attract the Male and Female working populations to join as subscribers. Therefore, supplemental analysis should be conducted to determine the Male population within Des Moines most densely populated area, as well as the Female population who either live and/or work in the most densely populated areas.

Generally speaking Des Moines is not a comparable city to NYC; however, the analysis shows that potential Citibike investors should focus on the prominence of the "last mile" problem within the city, consider it's upcoming population growth and how that may impact existing traffic patterns (yielding increased bike/ped use in the future), and assess the age/demographics of working adults in the area. Tourism to the city would only stand to increase profitablity through one-time customers,as NYC proved that an intimate understanding of subscribers is vital to CitiBikes future success.
